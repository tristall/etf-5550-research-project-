first deal with the financial data first (exchange rate)
figure out wavelet analysis
apply the data first, like point to point comparation 

modified  wavelet analysis would be better becase of theortically and it is consistent
why we better use the interval time series justify it for the paper ann provided
use clustering because like euro and german maybe in one cluster becassue it is all eourpope country ....
